## how to run
```
cd frontend
yarn expo start
```
this will create a QR code that can be used by the expo mobile app to view the app

## functionality that might not be obvious
- in the gallery, long press the icon to change it

## notes
- each folder has a list of channels. they're called 'channels' throughout the project since i originally planned to use youtube ids. this was changed to use a generic search meaning a channel can also be a keyword or anything else you would put in the youtube search bar
